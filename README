WordNet-SenseKey version 1.03
=============================

 The WordNet::Similarity package is designed to work with words in the
 form of lemma#pos#num  where "lemma" is the word lemma, "pos" is the
 part of speech, and "num" is the sense number.  Unfortuantely, the
 sense numbering is not stable from one WordNet release to another.
 Thus, for external programs, it can often be more useful to work with
 sense keys. Unfortunately, the Wordnet::Similarity package is unaware
 of sense keys. This class fills that gap.

 A description of sense keys may be found at

 or the man page 'senseidx(5WN)'
